      I am currently an undergraduate computer science student, a hobbiest
      roboticist, a developer and a programmer.
    </span>
    <span>
      I have always been curious about how and why things work and hence because
      of this curiosity I have always loved building and creating different
      things.

    <span>
      I love working on visualizations, websites and scripts that ease my life.
      I have also begun my journey into the world of robotics and electronics by
      slowing building projects with the help of microcontrollers.
